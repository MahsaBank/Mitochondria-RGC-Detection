This repository contains the code for training and predicting mitochondria in RGC boutons using an RGC detector within an EM volume. The RGC detector is a U-Net++ model with a ResNet-34 encoder. The model predicts the probabilities of a pixel belonging to an RGC mitochondrion. These probabilities can then be filtered using a threshold to obtain segmented RGC mitochondria. Finally, the 3D mitochondria can be rendered using the "mitoRGCPredictionsToVastSubs.py" script.
