This repository contains the code for training an RGC detector model and codes for predicting mitochondria in RGC boutons using the RGC detector within an EM volume. The RGC detector is a U-Net++ model with a ResNet-34 encoder. The model predicts the probabilities of a pixel belonging to an RGC mitochondrion. These probabilities can then be filtered using a threshold to obtain segmented RGC mitochondria. Finally, the 3D mitochondria can be rendered using the "mitoRGCPredictionsToVastSubs.py" script.
