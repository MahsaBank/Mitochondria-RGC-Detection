This repository contains the code for training an RGC detector model and predicting mitochondria in RGC boutons within an EM volume using the trained detector. The RGC detector is a U-Net++ model with a ResNet-34 encoder, designed to predict the probability of each pixel belonging to an RGC mitochondrion. These probabilities can be thresholded to obtain segmented RGC mitochondria. Finally, the segmented 3D mitochondria can be rendered using the "mitoRGCPredictionsToVastSubs.py" script.
